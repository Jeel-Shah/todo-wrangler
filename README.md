# TODO Wrangler for Obsidian

An Obsidian plugin that wrangles all lines starting with "TODO" in your notes and consolidates them under a unified "TODOs" section.

## Features

- Scan the current note for any lines starting with "TODO" or "- [] TODO" or "- TODO"
- Automatically consolidate found "TODO" lines into a "TODOs" section at the end of the note.
- One-click operation using the ribbon icon.

## Installation

### From GitHub

1. Navigate to the releases section of the GitHub repository.
2. Download the latest released `obsidian-extract-todo.zip`.
3. Extract the `obsidian-extract-todo` folder from the zip to your vault's plugins folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/`
