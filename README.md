# TODO Wrangler for Obsidian

An Obsidian plugin that wrangles all lines starting with "TODO" in your notes and consolidates them under a unified "TODOs" section.

## Features

- Scan the current note for any lines starting with "TODO" or "- [] TODO" or "- TODO"
- Automatically consolidate found "TODO" lines into a "TODOs" section at the end of the note.
- One-click operation using the ribbon icon.

## Installation

### From GitHub

1. Navigate to the releases section of the GitHub repository.
2. Download the latest released `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` from Releases.
3. Create the `todo-wrangler` in your vault's plugins folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/`
   - Note: If you don't have a plugins folder, create one inside the `.obsidian` directory.
4. Reload Obsidian
5. If everything was successful, you should see 'TODO Wrangler' in the list of installed plugins.

### From Within Obsidian

The plugin is available in the Obsidian plugin library ([TODO Wrangler](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=TODO%20Wrangler)). You can install
the plugin directly from within Obsidian by going to be Settings > Community plugins and searching for "TODO Wrangler".

## Usage

1. Open any note in Obsidian.
2. Open the command palette (`CMD + p` on Mac OS X)
3. Search and run "Wrangle Todos"
4. All lines in your note starting with "TODO" will be extracted and placed under a "TODOs" section at the end of the note.
   1. If you've changed the keyword in "Settings" then it will extract those.
   2. There are multiple variations of "TODO" (or keyword) it can handle; for instance, lists "- TODO".
